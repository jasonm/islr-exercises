7.1 Notes:

Hierarchy of linear models through nonlinear models:

* polynomials
* step functions
* splines
* local regression
* generalized additive models

First, we review polynomial regression

Then looking at step functions.  Introduce dummy variables for
the various step ranges.  Use "cutpoints" or "knots" for an
ordered factor variable (e.g. age ranges with cutpoints 18, 25, 40, 65, 90)
